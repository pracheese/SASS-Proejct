                <h1>New York City</h1>
                <p>
                    Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of 
                    five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five 
                    boroughs–Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island–were consolidated 
                    into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier 
                    gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in
                    New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home 
                    to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born 
                    population of any city in the world as of 2016.
